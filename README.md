# Mac Touchpad Chromaplane

"The Chromaplane is an electromagnetic syntesizer that is played using two electromagnetic pickup coils, that are moved over its surface to listen to a cloud of electromagnetic fields produced by the instrument. The instrument is fully analog and polyphonic, this makes the instrument ideal for both sculpting complex drones, and playing agile melodies."

There are 10 oscillators in a 3-4-3 hex grid type layout. Each plays a (configurable) note through an electronic coil oscilator thingee. A pickup (or two, but one is cool enough) is waved by the player over the device. As it hovers above the different oscillators, it picks them up - loud single tones when directly over one osc, combined tones when you're in-between.

I want to mimic this with a webapp that uses the mac touchpad's fine touch sensing on the touchpad or a mobile phones touch screen to mimic the effect. I want to use pressure (mac) or a slider (touchscreen phones with multi-touch) to control the volume (~height in the physical play style).

I also want to mimic the effects: "4-pole low pass filter that darkens the instrumentâ€™s sound, and a lo-fi delay/echo effect for space and ambiance."

Plan is to start with a mac touchpad version (what I'm coding on now) and then re-create it in mobile-friendly form later.

Current thingee is just a PoC GPT5 whipped up, which is fun to play with in safari on a mac at least ;)
